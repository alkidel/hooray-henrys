# Girl

Girl, i don’t want you to be a part-time  
I don’t want you to be the sunshine  
Be a full person by your own

Girl, i think you’ve underrated your part  
Get off the shadow, let’s get outside  
I don’t expect backstage for you  

Girl, i will never sell off my talks  
I leave mediocrity off my walk  
No pleasing meaningless love words  

Please look at me in the eyes  
If you want to be my girl  
Cause if you don’t  
Don’t you know that I will make you cry  
I’m looking forward, the future is ours  
Be confident, we won’t lose control  
There won’t be any need to hide  
There won’t be any need to swallow our pain  
Be confident, we won’t lose control  
We won’t lose control, we won’t lose control  

Girl, I don’t want me to be set unfree  
We both don’t have to turn a monster  
Watch out our minds, watch out our bodies  

God only knows what I’ll be  
God only knows what I’ll be  
God only knows what I’ll be  
Without you !
