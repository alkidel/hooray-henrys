# Keep On Groovin'

Oh keep on groovin' baby  
Keep groovin' alright  
Oh keep on groovin' baby  
Keep groovin' alright  

It's time we leave you now baby  
Keep groovin' alright  
We leave the stage now oh baby  
Keep groovin' alright  

We danced together baby  
And you've been alright   
We've been groovin' oh baby  
And you've been alright  

It's time we leave you now baby  
Keep groovin' alright  
We leave the stage now oh baby  
Keep groovin' alright
