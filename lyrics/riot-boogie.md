# Riot Boogie

Watch out boy  
I'm watching you  
Watch out girl  
I'm behind you  

(Beware) Don't think it's a party  
(Beware) Don't think we're chaperons  
For now, we're quiet  
But can't you notice  
We're surrounding you?  

Each of us has made its list  
And you are my number one  
I'm not going to let you go  
I'm waiting for the signal to come  

5... 4... 3... 2... 1...  
Go, go, go, go, go !!!  

Blood on the floor  
The job is done  
I've been fed with hate and fear  
His head and teeth will testify  

Don't think it's a party  
Don't think we're chaperons  
Of course, we were quiet  
Had you really not noticed  
We were surrounding you?
