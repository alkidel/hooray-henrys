# Great Disaster

I know I haven't introduced myself yet  
I will do it in a minute  
Just do it in a minute  

It might be too late now but I will catch you  
Catch you back in a minute  
Catch you back in a minute  

I know this is not my real life cause I'll  
Start it in a minute  
Just start it in a minute  

I know this is not my real life cause I'll  
Rock it in a minute  
Just rock it in a minute  

Our past is a great disaster  

Why can't there be a middle between  
The beginning and the end  
And is there no end to the ways in which I can  
Humiliate myself  

I shall always be glad that I met you  
But I feel that I've lost my very first prize  
I shall always be glad that I met you  
So help me find a second best  

Our past is a great disaster
