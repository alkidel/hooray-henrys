# No, Not Now

Oh no, she's not a secret now.  
But, nobody cares.  
Oh no, she's not a secret now.  
The wolves have smelled her scent.  
Oh no, she's not a secret now.  
But, nobody cares.  
Oh no, she's not a secret now.  

Some of us wouldn't be lying if we said we were trying too hard.  
But, it all works out in the end.  
Some of us would be trying too hard to begin lying.  
But... But, it seems to all work out in the end.  

Oh no, she's not a secret now.  
But, nobody cares.  
Oh no, she's not a secret now.  
The wolves have smelled her scent.  
Oh no, she's not a secret now.  
But, nobody cares.  
Oh no, she's not a secret now.  

Nobody likes a child who complains and I won't be that child anymore.
